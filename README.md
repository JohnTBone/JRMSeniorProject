Node.js for SeniorProject

This is the Node.js I was responsible for building for my Senior Project.

For my project, I partnered with a peer to create a forum-style Android application. The functionality was to allow students to subscribe to localized university courses where they could ask questions and respond to other questions.

My partner handled the Android side of the application. I was responsible for building a MongoDB database. I used Node.js to handle POST requests from Android, retrieve information from MongoDB, and then submit a response back to Android.
